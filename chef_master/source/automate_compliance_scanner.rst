The **Compliance** tab in your Chef Automate cluster allows you to upload, search, and view the profiles on your Chef Automate server, as well as the ability to filter on the compliance status of the nodes in your cluster. You can pivot your reports based on either the nodes or the profiles you have executed against those nodes.

If you are using Chef Automate 0.8.5, this functionality is hidden behind a ``beta`` feature flag. See the `Chef Automate 0.8.5 release notes </release_notes_chef_automate.html##what-s-new-in-0-8-5>`_ for more details.
